# phpmanual.github.io/br

<https://phpmanual.github.io/br>

List all maintainers (a), crediteds (b), translators (c, a+b), listed translators (d) and unlisted translators (e) in order to ease updating contributors in <https://svn.php.net/viewvc/phpdoc/pt_BR/trunk/translation.xml?view=markup> and/or <https://svn.php.net/viewvc/phpdoc/pt_BR/trunk/bookinfo.xml?view=markup>

## Motivation

During PHP Translation Fest Brasil 2014 PHP Manual got a lot of new contributors and @php.net people, however not all of them are listed on <http://doc.php.net/revcheck.php?p=translators&lang=pt_BR> even having contributions (in CREDITS or as MAINTAINER).

So, this project is created for having this information open and clear, so maintainers can update <https://svn.php.net/viewvc/phpdoc/pt_BR/trunk/translation.xml?view=markup> and/or <https://svn.php.net/viewvc/phpdoc/pt_BR/trunk/bookinfo.xml?view=markup> as soon as possible as a mean of engagment of contributors.
